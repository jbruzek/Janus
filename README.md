I wanted a way to import all of my transaction records from my different accounts and get real numbers about investment performance. It feels like the information is never as easy to find on the brokers' dashboards as I would like, and even when it is the numbers appear dumbed down. I want lots of data, I want to run reports for custom date ranges, and I want to know where the calculations are coming from. 

I called it Janus because I thought it needed a cool name.

In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, frames, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past. 

...but more importantly Janus sounds like a cool name.
